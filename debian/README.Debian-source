libswarmcache-java
==================

The upstream supplied CVS sources contain binary jar files. Currently
no clean source distribution exists. Therefore, the upstream sources
were modified to comply with the Debian Free Software Guidelines.

Use the rules/get-orig-source target to create the orig.tar.gz.
For more details on repackaging of upstream sources please see the 
debian/orig-tar.sh file.
